      <h2>Hello.</h2>
      <p class="present">I'm Benjamin Lefebvre, a French Canadian, as you probably already know from the beginning of this page. I have a background in marketing; however, my love for challenges and covid made me realize my passion for coding. I currently live in
        Toronto, but I love travelling.</p>

        <h3>Coding</h3>
        <p>I started learning coding in high school when one of my teachers told us some students created a software for a science fair. I then took on the challenge to learn, and it never stopped me from exploring more on the subject!</p>
        <h3>UI Design</h3>
        <p>Since I was a kid, my mom used to work as a graphic designer for a newspaper in the small town I come from. I have always shown interest in beautiful design, and my mother used to challenge me into designing newspaper ads on photoshop.</p>

        <h3>Marketing</h3>
        <p>Maybe it comes from my experience as a kid and my love for design, but I always thought marketing would be a good skills to learn. In the end, everyone need some of those skills to be able to sell themselves or their product!</p>
        <h3>Branding</h3>
        <p>The result from mixing marketing to design.</p>
